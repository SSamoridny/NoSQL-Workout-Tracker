## Usage:

         Upon opening the app you will be at the start screen where you can add a workout or continue a workout. On selection you will be taken to another screen where you will be prompted to use either resistance or cardio. Once that is chosen you will fill out your choices and follow the prompts to ensure an acurate description of your workout. When that is saved you can then keep on adding to your fitness tracker or you can view the dashboard to see how your workouts are going.
